# Code Review and Refactoring Task

## BookingController.php

### What is good:
- The logic is functional and follows Laravelâ€™s MVC structure.
- It uses repositories to separate concerns, which is a good practice.

### What needs improvement:
- The controller is handling too much business logic. It would be better to delegate more logic to repositories or services.
- The methods are somewhat large and could be split for better readability and maintainability.

## BookingRepository.php

### What is good:
- The repository pattern is being used, which helps keep database queries separate from the controller.
  
### What needs improvement:
- The code can be refactored to reduce duplication and improve efficiency.
- Complex queries or logic inside methods should be broken down into smaller pieces.
